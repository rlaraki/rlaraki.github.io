### User Guide

The website is composed of a 4-buttons menu. From the choice of the selected button, a corresponding map is shown with more precise data in the right scroll view. 

The table below summarizes the functionnalities of theses buttons.

|Button|Description|
|---|---|
| Cases|The map for cases shows the cumulative number of cases per region, which are represented by the red circles. A slider on the top of map allows the user to visualise how the number of cases per region evolves by the time. The user can select a country to visualize a line plot of the evolution of the number of cases and a sankey diagram that shows the ratio of women/men that are alive/dead. For each additional selected country, a new line in the line plot is drawn and an additional sankey diagram is shown. Some lines or sankey diagram may not be shown due to the missing data for some countries.|
|Deaths|The map for cases shows the cumulative number of deaths per region, which are represented by the black circles. A slider on the top of map allows the user to visualise how the number of deaths per region evolves by the time.
